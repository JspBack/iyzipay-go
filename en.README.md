## Known Problems

[GENERAL]

- Unauthorized (401) errors cause panic (because the error format is different).
- MarketPlace, Subscription, Cancel, Refund, and Iyzilink examples are missing (not tested yet or not working properly).

[IYZILINK]

- Iyzilink integration has issues with IyzilinkUpdate and IyzilinkDelete returning 'system error'.
- IyzilinkGetDetail and IyzilinkGetList data are filtered incorrectly. This is a temporary solution as the data returned by IyzilinkGetDetail is of the same type as IyzilinkGetList, which is not correct.
